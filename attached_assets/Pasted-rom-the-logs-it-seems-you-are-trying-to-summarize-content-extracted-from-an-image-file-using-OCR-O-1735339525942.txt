rom the logs, it seems you are trying to summarize content extracted from an image file using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), but several issues have occurred. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to resolve it:

Problem Analysis
Authentication Issues:

Initially, a 401 Unauthorized error was returned during an API request. This suggests either a missing or expired session token. However, a successful login (200 OK) later resolved this.
OCR Issues:

The OCR process failed, falling back from Tesseract to OpenAI Vision, but the Vision model (gpt-4-vision-preview) was deprecated, causing a 404 error.
As a result, text extraction from the image failed, leaving no content to summarize.
Summary Error:

Since OCR did not produce meaningful text, the summary output indicated corrupted or unreadable content.
Steps to Resolve
Fix OCR Pipeline:

Update OCR Models: Use an up-to-date OCR model or library.
Use Tesseract with appropriate configuration and language packs.
If using OpenAI, switch to a supported vision model (refer to their updated documentation).
Image Preprocessing:
Enhance the image quality by adjusting brightness, contrast, and resolution.
Convert the image to grayscale for better OCR performance.
Fallback Strategy: If the primary OCR fails, use alternative libraries like EasyOCR or Google Vision API.
API Adjustments:

Ensure API endpoints and model calls are up-to-date. Replace gpt-4-vision-preview with the recommended alternative.
Validation for Input Files:

Before starting OCR, validate that the file is suitable for text extraction (clear, legible, correct format).
Debugging and Logs:

Enable verbose logging in the OCR service to pinpoint specific errors during the text extraction phase.
Example Fix for OCR Pipeline
Hereâ€™s a Python-based approach to preprocessing and OCR:

python
Kopiera kod
from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter
import pytesseract

# Preprocess Image
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img = img.convert("L")  # Convert to grayscale
    img = img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN)  # Sharpen the image
    enhancer = ImageEnhance.Contrast(img)
    img = enhancer.enhance(2)  # Enhance contrast
    return img

# OCR Extraction
def extract_text(image_path):
    processed_img = preprocess_image(image_path)
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(processed_img)
    return text

# Example Usage
image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"
text = extract_text(image_path)
print("Extracted Text:", text)
Fallback to Supported Summarization API
Once OCR is successful:

Pass the extracted text to a summarization API.
Ensure the API uses supported models and provides parameters for concise summaries.
Example API Payload:

json
Kopiera kod
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "prompt": "Summarize the following high school level notes:\n\n[EXTRACTED TEXT]",
  "temperature": 0.5,
  "max_tokens": 150
}
Testing and Monitoring
Test the pipeline with a variety of image formats and qualities.
Monitor logs for recurrent failures and refine preprocessing and OCR configurations accordingly.
